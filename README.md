# Hello-World

A sample repository created for the purpose of saying "Hello!" to the world. 

I stil remember making this. As I've stated, this is an alt acct, and was forgotten for a long time. This is one of only two repositories that were created before it was abandoned. The other was projectifier, which was actually going to be really cool had it been finished. As it happened, while this acct sat abandoned, someone else got the idea and beat me to the finish line. I may build a simple cli-based version with a subset of the original intended functionalities. This would fit well inside my current project: `Rapidev dev-toolbox`
